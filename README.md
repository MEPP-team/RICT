## The needs
A brief description of the [early needs](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/EarlyNeeds.md).

## Objective
The objective of the RICT (Representation Information CiTy) project is to design and realize 
  * a backend: an infrastructure enabling the storage of city related data, as well as hosting and executing computational models using the backend data.  
  * a frontend: a simple interactive visualizer of the backend data 
 
### Aimed backend features
The aimed backend features could be:
 * offer some [ETL tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) starting from standard (or de facto standards used by mainstream crowd sourcing site like [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap)) of City related data   
 * distributed logical data (?)
 * abstract level data access (i.e. use accessor API that are directly derived out of [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) expressed [information models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_model)  
 * computational model execution engine
 
 ### Aimed frontend features
 The aimed frontend features could be:
   * 3D visualization of a territory
   * Use the [iTowns](http://www.itowns-project.org/) JS/WEBGL component (?)
