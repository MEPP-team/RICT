### Generate postgresql database tables diagram
 - [schemaspy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3223770/tools-to-generate-database-tables-diagram-with-postgresql) looked promising but is hard to deploy. For example whatever arguments you provide for host, port, password it will generate something in `./schemapy/index.html` instead of complaining about wrong authentication (or could it be that is a social engineering scam to obtain the access codes?)
 - [Mysql-workbench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_Workbench) runs ok but ... only works with MySQL.
