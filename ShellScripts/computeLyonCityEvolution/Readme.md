This directory holds different ways of computing the so called Lyon city evolution (which is a pre-requisite of [this computation](https://github.com/MEPP-team/py3dtiles/blob/Tiler/Tilers/CityTiler/Install.md#5b-running-the-temporal-version-citytemporaltiler)):
  -	[ShellScript](ShellScript/README.md): this shell script version is the reference one. It will require that you install all the dependencies on your host (which might prove quite tricky)...
  - [ShellScriptCallingDocker](ShellScriptCallingDocker): the main control loop (i.e. the workflow) of this version is shell-script based but the atomic treatments trigger docker containers. They are thus no dependencies to install but Docker. 
  - [Cwl](Cwl/Readme.md): this version follows the same logic as the ShellScriptCallingDocker one, except that the workflow is decribed with the [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/)
  - [AirFlow](AirFlow/Readme.md): this version uses [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) in order to express the workflow. Getting this version to run will require you to install many of its heavy duty production server dependencies like Kuberntes, a webs-based GUI controler, a scheduler, a PostgreSQL database...

Note: the [Docker](Docker/Readme.md) directory holds the docker contexts required to buid the containers which usage is shared by ShellScriptCallingDocker, Cwl as well as the Airflow versions.
