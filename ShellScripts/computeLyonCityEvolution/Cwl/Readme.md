## Forget about using cwltool --print-dot to compute workflow diagram
Alas as explained [here](https://www.biostars.org/p/366246/) (but also in [this issue](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/issues/203) or [that issue](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/issues/202) or suggested [here](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues/7)) the output of [`cwltool --print-dot'](https://pypi.org/project/cwltool/) is **NOT nearly as nice** as the ones of [cwlviewer](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer) (refer below). For example it misses input and output boxes...

## Using cwlviewer to compute workflow diagram imposes a git URL to your workflow
A recurent need is to compute your favorite full/integrated worklow diagram. This starts by running [`cwtool --pack`](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool#combining-parts-of-a-workflow-into-a-single-document) e.g. with
```
cwtool --pack my_favorite_workflow.cwl > my_integrated_workflow.cwl
```
that collects all the sub-referenced (e.g. pointed by `run` entries) and then by using [cwlviewer ](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer) on the result. Note that the resulting `my_integrated_workflow.cwl` is a temporary file (that requires updating each time a sub-workflow gets updated) that one does not want to commit on a git repository.
This prevents using the [online cwl viewer version](https://view.commonwl.org/) that requires an URL link to the workflow to be viewed. 

Now one might think that using a combination of a localhost running version of [cwlviewer ](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer) together with a lightweight htpp server to expose your workflow through an URL might get you on track.
For example you might try doing something something like

```
cwtool --pack my_favorite_workflow.cwl > my_integrated_workflow.cwl
python3 -m http.server &
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer.git
cd cwlviewer/
docker-compose up
```
and opening your favorite web-browser on `http://localhost:8080/` in order to to provide `http://localhost:8000/my_integrated_workflow.cwl`.
This strategy will alas fail because you missed reading the smallprints of [cwl viewer](https://view.commonwl.org/) that asks your URL worklow to be a **Git repository URL** (like on Github or Gitlab...). You got bitten...
