## General description of the project
[Lyon Métropole](https://www.grandlyon.com/) is developing an ambitious open data policy based on the acquisition and organization of open territorial data. This centralization allows the animation and co-creation of services for the benefit of public uses and the smart city of tomorrow. The objective of this project is to set up a 4D model (3D + Time) favoring the use of data and their appropriation by users. Numerous use cases are possible and can range from supporting change from a changing neighborhood to help decision-making or risk awareness, for example.

In order to initialize this collaborative project, between the Grand Lyon Métropole (with [Erasme Living Lab](http://www.polepixel.fr/residents/erasme/), DINSI, …) and LabEx IMU (ELICO, EVS and LIRIS Lab), this approach requires the installation of an expanded model of the territory. The goal is nevertheless to think at the same time the creation of opportunities for use through a team of computer scientists, object designers, mediation specialists, content gamification specialists. The necessary skills around the student are multiple. Erasme will bring his expertise in product design, content ludification and animate the phases of ideation around the chosen uses. Their expertise in designing and constructing physical devices will be of real added value.

The skills in data science of LIRIS will allow to better apprehend the data in collaboration with Grand Lyon Metrople (DINSI) and their representations, but also to bring all the necessary expertise to the construction of spatio-temporal models.
Elico and EVS Research lab will provide expertise on mediation, collaboration and crowdsourcing. The aim is to define two or three use cases that will allow, alongside designers and mediation specialists, to prefigure the model, the possible interactions and the scenario to be put in place.

SPL Confluence is providing data, a mock-up and participate to the creation of possible use-cases.

## Introduction
The goal of the MAM project is to build an AugMented Model (MAM) of a neighborhood of the [Lyon Métropole](https://www.grandlyon.com/). This augmented physical model will be augmented through the overlaying of statistical and dynamical data coming from [Lyon Open Data](https://data.grandlyon.com/) together with data sourced within various research labs. Along this project different types of models will co-exist
 - a classical physical model (3D printed) 
 - a 3D numerical model, with various different types of data, that will be projected on the physical model
 - a virtual 3D model that can be visualized through [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)

The 3D numerical model will be based on the [iTowns](http://www.itowns-project.org/) technology together with the [UDV](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV) add-on.

Once the above described models are available, some use case scenarios must be produced in order to elaborate on the ergonomy of interaction.
