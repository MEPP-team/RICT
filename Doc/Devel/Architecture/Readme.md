## Architecture

### People
 * [Tatjana Kutzner (from TUM)](https://www.gis.bgu.tum.de/unser-team/lehrstuhlangehoerige/dr-tatjana-kutzner/)
    - Defines [ADE (network among others)](https://github.com/TatjanaKutzner/CityGML-UtilityNetwork-ADE) 
    - [Tatjana Kutzner's thesis (chapter 4.1 p63)](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1341432/1341432.pdf) states that the key point is the ATL (Transformation Language) availability. In chapter 4.3.2 three tools are mentions FME (proprietary), Go Publisher (proprietary) and HALE (open-source).

 * [MEGA UML](http://www.mega.com/en/resource/mega-uml-hopex) by [MEGA](http://www.mega.com/en)
 * Generate postgresql database tables diagram with  
    - [schemaspy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3223770/tools-to-generate-database-tables-diagram-with-postgresql) looked promising but couldn't make it work. Whatever arguments you provide for host, port, password it will generate something in `./schemapy/index.html` instead of complaining about wrong authentication (or could it be that is a social engineering scam to obtain the access codes?)
    - Note: Mysql-workbench only works with MySQL...

  * [A Reminder On Three/MultiTier Layer Architecture Design](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AReminderOnThreeMultiTierLayerArchitectureDesignBroughtToYouByMyLateNightFrustrations.aspx) (by Scott Hanselman): **"If you are designing a layer, know your in's and out's and for Goodness' Sake know your responsibility.  If you don't, back to the drawing board until you do."**
  * [Difference between CRUD and REST](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/120716/difference-between-rest-and-crud): [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) means the basic operations to be done in a data repository. [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) operates on resource  representations (complex objects abstractions), each one identified by an URL. In short: **same thing, different layers** (CRUD falls within the Data Access layer while REST fits in the Business layer).
  * [Stateless vs Stateful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol) protocols: there can be **complex interactions between stateful and stateless protocols** among **different protocol layers**. For example, HTTP is an example of a stateless protocol layered on top of TCP, a stateful protocol, which is layered on top of IP, another stateless protocol, which is routed on a network that employs BGP, another stateful protocol. Note: REST**ful** is state**less**.
