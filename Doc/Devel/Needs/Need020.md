# Need 020: manage ([CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) [extended documents](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#extended-document) 

BREAK DOWN THIS NEED INTO 3 sub-needs
 1. offer a placeholder (database): have this issue  https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/35 point to it.
 2. offer an web based API for accessing: this requires defining the exchange format (e.g. CZML): have this issue https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/37 point to it
 3. realize the UDV integration of such information (using the above API): have this issue https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/36 point to it.
 Relate this need to [need12](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need012.md)

WATCH OUT: there is also 
  -[this issue with need13 that is closely related (redundant ?)](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/4)
  - [that issue  with need 12 under the hood](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/36)

    - [guided tours](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#guided-tour)
