### User story
As a [Content Contributor](Roles.md#content-contributor), I want to be able to place documents in the 3D scene.

### Description
The possible types of documents are:
 - image: photo, diagram, drawing, maps...
 - text
 - audio
 - video
 
 They are two distinguished means for placing a document in a scene:
  - pinpoint where the document is georeferenced to some location (point) 
  - spatial position where the document is 
     - placed at a spatial position (3D over the territory)
     - oriented (e.g. with its normal in a case of an image)
     - scaled (spatial dimensions of the image)
 
 They are three display modes:
   - screen overlay: the document is attached to the screen that overlays the scene. When moving the camera the document display remains unchanged within the screen.
   - billboard: this mode presents a pinpointed document as a standing billboard (always facing camera position) refer to `[1]`
   - scene overlay: the image has a (fixed) spatial position. From a very specific viewpoint the image appears as fitting the geometry of scene. When moving the camera out of this specific viewpoint the image remains at the same spatial position (within the scene) i.e. the image is attached to the scene not to the camera position. But away from the very specific viewpoint the image/scene fitting is visually lost (not apparent anymore).

Two different tools are needed:
 1. pinpoint locator: it allows to pintpoint a document (i.e. select, through mouse click, a georeferenced position and associate this pinpoint location to the document)
 2. ergonomic spatial positioner: the need here specifies 
    - the what: to provide a spatial position for an image document.
    - the how: a ergonomic mouse (keyboard?) based tool that allows the user to pick up an image and assists the user in placing it (position, orientation, scale) spatially within the scene such that the image appears as fitting the geometry of scene.
