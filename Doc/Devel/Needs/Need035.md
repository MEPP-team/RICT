### User story
As an historian I can define the contents of Extended Documents shared in my scientific domain. 
As an [Developer](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#developer) 
I want to translate the historian provided knowledge into a formal structure of Extended Documents 
that is based on well known types (text, images)
