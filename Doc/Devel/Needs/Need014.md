# Need 014: Provide a user friendly interface to add one document

[Issue](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/44)

### User story

As an historian I want to be able to 
  - define a document structure based on well known types (text, images) 
  - and share an [Extended Document](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#extended-document) (a [document](Definitions.md#document) together with some [associatate metadata](Definitions.md#document-metadata)) through a web based site.

### Beneficiary role: 
[City Knowledgeable Person](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person)

### Impact: 
minor

### Tags or keywords

### Component
 * [Authoring interface](Definitions.md#authoring-interface)

### Description
A user-friendly interface that allows the user to upload one file (picture, drawing...) at a time along with specifying the metadata.
 
### Notes:
This need differs from [Need 028](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need028.md). Need 028 is a process (e.g. script) allowing to import extended documents in the database from e.g. an excel file and a set of files. This need is a user friendly interface above this process.

The metadatas requirements have not been defined yet.
