# Need 014: Manage documents and their links with other city objects and documents

### User story

As an historian I want to be able to add, modify, delete the [documents](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#document), [city object links](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#city-object-reference) and [scenario links](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#scenario-reference) so that I can provide more information about [city objects](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#city-object) or [regions of the city](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#region-of-a-city-model-fixme) model.
