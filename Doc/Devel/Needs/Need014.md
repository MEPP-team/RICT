### Component
 * [Authoring interface](Definitions.md#authoring-interface)

### Description
A user-friendly interface that allows the user to upload one file (picture, drawing...) at a time along with specifying the metadata.
 
### Notes:
This need differs from [Need 028](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need028.md). Need 028 is a process (e.g. script) allowing to import extended documents in the database from e.g. an excel file and a set of files. This need is a user friendly interface above this process.

The metadatas requirements have not been defined yet.
