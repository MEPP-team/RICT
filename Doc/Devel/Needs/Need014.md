### User story

As an historian I want to be able to share an [Extended Document](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#extended-document) (as defined by [need 35](Need035.md)) through a web based site.

### Beneficiary role: 
[City Knowledgeable Person](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person)

### Impact: 
minor

### Maturity: 
ongoing

### Cost evaluation: ?

### Tags or keywords

### Component
 * [Authoring interface](Definitions.md#authoring-interface)

### Description
A user-friendly interface that allows the user to upload one file (picture, drawing...) at a time along with specifying the metadata.
 
### Notes:
This need differs from [Need 028](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need028.md): need 028 is a process (e.g. script) allowing the importation of a set of extended documents whereas this need focuses on submitting a single document through an web based interface.
