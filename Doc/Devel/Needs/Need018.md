# Need 018 : Provide means for streaming and visualisation of semantic and hierarchical information of city objects 

### User story
As a city knowledgeable person, I want to access semantic information attached to the geometry of city objects (e.g. select a building and see its attached semantic information or select a wall and see its attached semantic information)
As a computational model person, I want to access semantic information attached to the geometry so that I can run a view composition analysis.

Aggregator super need :
* Need 019: [navigate from selected geometries within the interface to the attached semantic information](Need019.md)

### Beneficiary role: 
City knowledgeable person, general audience

### Impact: 
Major

### Maturity:
Ongoing

### Cost evaluation:
1 - 2 weeks

### Tags or keywords

### Description
Geometry is a restricted concern that might not be sufficient (e.g. to the considered domain of concern like noise, economics, light, sociology...) when modeling (representing) cities. It is also usefull to have 
  - semantic information such as the kind of city objects (this is the type of object) 
  - a modeling hierarchy between such levels of semantic information
  - additional (to the geometry) information concerning these city objects such as the owner of a terrain (these are the object attributes)
