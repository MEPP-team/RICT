  * [A Reminder On Three/MultiTier Layer Architecture Design](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AReminderOnThreeMultiTierLayerArchitectureDesignBroughtToYouByMyLateNightFrustrations.aspx) (by Scott Hanselman): **"If you are designing a layer, know your in's and out's and for Goodness' Sake know your responsibility.  If you don't, back to the drawing board until you do."**
  * [Difference between CRUD and REST](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/120716/difference-between-rest-and-crud): [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) means the basic operations to be done in a data repository. [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) operates on resource  representations (complex objects abstractions), each one identified by an URL. In short: **same thing, different layers** (CRUD falls within the Data Access layer while REST fits in the Business layer).
