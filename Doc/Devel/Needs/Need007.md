### Description

A step consist of a document associated with a position + rotation (in the 3d scene), a date, and complementary text. The user is able to move from step to step using "previous step" and "next step" buttons. The movement from step A position to step B position is scripted (no user input needed) : the camera is smoothly translated and rotated from step A to step B. The city representation evolves according to time, from step A date to step B date. On a given step, the camera is in [Oriented Camera Mode](Definitions.md#oriented-camera-mode).
