# Need 005: Adding a temporal dimension to city models

### User story
As an [historian](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person), I want to add a temporal dimension to city models. I want to be able to store different versions of city models corresponding to different periods of time. I also want to be able to visualise the evolution of the city along the time using a 4D (spatio-temporal) representation of the city.

Related need :
* Need 003: [document-enhanced 4d representation of the city to detail historical processes](Need003.md)

Sub Needs:

  * Need 010: [database modeling of temporal dimension of city models](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need010.md)
  * Need 016: [Ergonomic exploration of time](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need016.md)
  * Need 017: [Develop a server to stream PostGIS 3D objects and having a temporal dimension to the web](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need017.md)
