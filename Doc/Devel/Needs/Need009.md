### Description

Using textures instead of solid colors, the 3d representation can get visually closer reality. Graphists spent time to create textures visually coherent with the historical reality, using historical photos as visual reference. City models from Grand Lyon also have matching textures with them, which would be a good addition to the 3d representation.

### Notes:
Textures are not unique. It should be possible to display sets of textures depending on the end user domain (e.g. thermic view).
