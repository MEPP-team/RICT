### Description
An oriented camera mode would need the following features :
* triggered by clicking on a billboard document (in the 3d scene), or from the document browser
* moves the user to the date and position of the document, and orients the camera to view the subject of the document
* adds a detailed version of the doc in/over the 3d scene, to allow the user to see the correspondance between reconstructed 3d scene and historical data
* used throughout all the guided tour (each step of the tour is in oriented camera mode)
* provides the ability to adjust the opacity of the image to see the correspondance between reconstructed 3d scene and historical data. 
* modifies user controls to prevent breaking the alignment between doc and scene.
* hides all the documents (billboards) in the scene (visual clarity)
