### Description
The GUI will need to provide access to the following functionalities :
- 3d scene window : display preference & camera controls
- temporal evolution : jump to a date, specify start/end date (animation), move slider to change time
- document browser : previous/next doc, related doc, filters, search, orient doc + camera in the 3d scene
- guided tour : means to access the tour(s), start, exit, previous/next step

The GUI will use minimizing/maximimizing windows & sliders to keep from being too cluttered
