### Description
- [x] The state of a (displayed) city at a given historical moment includes the city geometries of the city objects 
- [ ] The user interaction (with the interface) in order to select an historical moment must be done with a slider (or with any interface element specifying an historical moment e.g. the media browser)
- [x] Within the interface the temporal mode is toggable (can be tuned On/Off)

### Notes:
This need is located within the GUI component and hooks up the triggers (to possibly external functionality)
