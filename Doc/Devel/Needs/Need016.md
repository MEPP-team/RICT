# Need 016 : Ergonomic exploration of time
 

### User story
As [historian](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person), I want (within the interface) to select an historical moment (among the set of predefined moments) so that the displayed city corresponds to the state of the city as it was at this moment.

### Tags or keywords

### Description
- the state of a (displayed) city at a given historical moment includes the city geometries of the city objects 
- the user interaction (with the interface) in order to select an historical moment must be done with a slider (or with any interface element specifying an historical moment e.g. the media browser)
- within the interface the temporal mode is toggable (can be tuned On/Off)

### Notes:
This need is located within the GUI component and hooks up the triggers (to possibly external functionality)
