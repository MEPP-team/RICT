# Need 013: Visualization of documents within a 3D representation of the city

### User story
As a historian I want to visualize and locate documents (images, videos, text...) in the 3d representation of the city. I need a preview of what the document is, and a visual indication of its position in the scene.

Document Visualization

### Description
The need can be fulfilled by billboards [1] integrated in the 3d representation of the city, anchored to the city object which is the subject of the document. Filtering/culling of the billboards may be needed to avoid cluttering. However [1] has been tested in a desktop environment and we also need to test this in a web environment.
