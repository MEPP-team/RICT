## Definitions
### Requirement
**Definition**: a **[requirement](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/)** is a capability that a product must possess or something a product must do in order to ultimately satisfy a customer need.

A requirement **targets a technical audience** as its readers, like engineers, developers, project manager and testers. Requirements might be described with a bias of a porticular implementation and must outline and detail exactly **what needs to be delivered** (as a componennt of the product). For example:
 * Requirement 1: "The system (i.e. delivered system or product) shall be able to register an customer item through the specification of the following attributes: an textual ID (20 characters long), comments (2000 characters long) and its retail price (currency)."
 * Requirement 2: "The system shall be able to visualize up to 1024 building (for the 3D mode)." 

### Need 
**Definition**: a **need** or [feature](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/) is a set of related requirements that allows the user to satisfy a "business" objective or need.

Needs are thus high level requirements that **target management or project leader** and abstracts the technical details. For example
 * Need 1: "We need to offer web based access to city visualisation."
 * Need 2: "The portal of the system should list all the available city datas."
