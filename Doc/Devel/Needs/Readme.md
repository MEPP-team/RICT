## Definitions
### Requirement
**Definition**: a **[requirement](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/)** is a capability that a product must possess or something a product must do in order to ultimately satisfy a customer need.

A requirement **targets a technical audience** as its readers, like engineers, developers, project manager and testers. Requirements might be described with a bias of a particular implementation and must outline and detail exactly **what needs to be delivered** (as a componennt of the product). For example:
 * Requirement 1: "The system (i.e. delivered system or product) shall be able to register a customer item through the specification of the following attributes: an textual ID (20 characters long), comments (2000 characters long) and its retail price (currency)."
 * Requirement 2: "The system shall be able to visualize up to 1024 building (for the 3D mode)." 

### Need 
**Definition**: a **need** or [feature](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/) is a set of related requirements that allows the user to satisfy a "business" objective or need.

Needs are thus high level requirements that **target general audience like management or project leader** and abstracts the technical details. For example
 * Need 1: "We need to offer web based access to city visualisation."
 * Need 2: "The portal of the system should list all the available city datas."
 
 ## When, why and how to write a need
A need arises when formalizing new product ideas informally expressed during a brainstorm, overheard at a conference/meeting, or mentioned during discussions with product users. The main reason for formalizing a need ("ideas" can come from many sources, but needs cannot be written by the general audience) is to provide a support for discussing and assessing (political decision) the product evolutions opportunities. 

The key purpose of a need is thus to untangle the initial idea, its implicit/explicit assumptions about the solution a new answering feature would solve. A need must thus clearly express what problem it addresses (even though they are possibly many features or approaches that could solve it) as well as specify means to assess when it is solved. In other terms the questions to answer when writing a need are:
 * What problem are we trying to solve? (Why should we be doing this? What is the pain?)
 * Who are we trying to solve this problem for? (Who's pain would be relieved?)
 * How will we know if we succeed? (what is hoped outcome?) 

The description of a need should have the following items:
 * **Identifier**: a string of the form `N<integer_need_number>` e.g. `N042`.
 * **User story**: a suggestive one liner description in the form "As a [role], I want to [do something] so that [reason/benefit]".
 * **Beneficiary role**: the role (researcher, developper, operations) that would directly benefit from the realisation of the need. 
 * **Impact**: choose among critical (project maker), major (would have heavy/significant benefits) or minor (nice to have).
 * **Maturity**: choose among immature, ongoing, mature, complete
 * **Cost evaluation**: some ball park estimation in man weeks or man months for its full realization (requirements, designs, implementation, tests, packaging, integration, documentation).
 * **Tags or keywords**: be them known (client, server, database) or not already mentioned (user experience...).
