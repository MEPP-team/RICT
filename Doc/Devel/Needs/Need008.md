### Description
Parts of the city were reconstructed (3d models & textures) from historical documents. In some cases, the information is not complete and an interpretation must be made to allow for a full reconstruction. This leads to varying levels of historical accuracy.
Example : building footprint is fully know from a historical map, but building height must be "guessed" from incomplete photos. We would like to inform the user of this varying accuracy in the reconstructed parts.
Possibility : color coding of the 3d models (grey is certain, pink is certain for footprint but not for height, etc)
