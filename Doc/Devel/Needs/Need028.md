### Tags or keywords

### Description:
We require a mechanism allowing users to CRUD from:
  * a set of documents
  * a set of description files (e.g. excel files) giving infomation about such documents, e.g. links/references to other city objects, dates, origin, etc.

The data model must be consistent with the one of [Need 20](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need020.md)
