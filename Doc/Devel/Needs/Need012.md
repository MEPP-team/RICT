### Cost evaluation:

### Description
This need can be answered with three sub-parts:
  * Backend: Database physical model (logical model being available)
  * Transmission of the media from the Database to the client: the question concerns the exchange format (that must be chosen as opposed to re-implemented whenever as possible) and the database adapter (emitter) UI adapter (reciever)
  * User Interface


End users will need the capacity to browse through a document base. Access to document metadata is needed to give the user more info, move his camera the the document's subject area in the 3d scene, and to link the document to other documents.
