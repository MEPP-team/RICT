### Notes:
[Sequence diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram):
 1. the applications requests a refreshement of the scene for a given date to the iTowns framework 
 2. some iTown sub-component (3dtiles provider) passes the time-stat-city request to a 3Dtiles-server (or a server adapter)
 3. the 3Dtiles-server forwards the request to a DBCity server
 3. the DBCity server replies with a collection of a cityobjects to the 3Dtiles-server
 4. 3Dtiles-server packages the answer into a b3dm object that it handles 
    over to the iTowns framework
 5. The 3Dtiles-provider parses the b3dm object to convert it to Threejs object (mesh) 
    that is integrated to the scene
