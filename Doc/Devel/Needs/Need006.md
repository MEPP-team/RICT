### Description:

**Camera control** : various ways of moving the user (camera) through the 3d scene. Current (existing) user controls : translation with left mouse click + drag, rotation/orbit with right mouse click + drag, zoom with mousewheel. Could be made more ergonomic (eg : google map) with clamping, speed adjustments and orbit modification.

**Shortcuts** : scripted camera movement from current user position to a target position. Orientation also adjusted to match a specific target orientation. Both movement and orientation can be smoothed (speed follows a sigmoid curve). Example : clicking on a document moves the camera to the relevant position and orientation (to match the document subject). Also used in guided tours to move from step to step. Could also be used to move the user when he clicks on a position on the **minimap**.
