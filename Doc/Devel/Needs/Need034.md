# Need 034: Improved temporal navigation slider

[Issue 47](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/47)

### User story
As a [City Knowledgeable Person](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person), I want to navigate in time and in multiple scenarisations.

### Tags or keywords
viewpoints, visualization

### Description
Based on the observation of different points of view or sources to explain one particular event,the need rose to provide a way to visualize multiple versions of the city. 
For example, one historian has a scenario (sequence of chronological events supported by extended documents) that explains the events that led to the construction of one particular building. However, another historian has a different scenario/explanation that leads to the construction of the same building. We want to allow different scenarisations and navigate between them.
