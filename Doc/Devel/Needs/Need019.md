## Need 019 : navigate from selected geometries within the interface to the attached semantic information

### User story
As a GUI user, I want to retrieve the semantic information attached 
to some geometry displayed in the interface so that I can then explore
and navigate that semantic information within the interface.

Sub Needs :
* Need 011: [a graphical user interface (GUI)](Need011.md)
* Need 018: [Provide means for streaming and visualisation of semantic and hierarchical information of city objects](Need018.md)

### Description
This is essentially a technical need requiring the ability to retrieve semantic information (a priori not sent at first to the client GUI) out of the selection of a geometry displayed by the GUI. More precisely, and at first, obtaining the graphical representation of the geometry doesn't require more information than...the geometry. But once display this need expresses the fact that the GUI is a mean to retrieve semantic information and thus the client must have the ability to retrieve that information. When sent to the GUI the geometric information must thus be attached/decorated with a reference some information allowing to retrieve semantic information linked/related to that information.

### Notes:
Note that nothing is said about the hierarchic level of the semantic information that is attained.
