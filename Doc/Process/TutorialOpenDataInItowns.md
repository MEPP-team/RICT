## Install iTowns
 
After you install [iTowns](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns) this [fork and branch](https://github.com/NikoSaul/itowns2/tree/dataZanzibar)

for start the server you should have run with this command (for iTowns him self)

```` npm start ```` ==> ```` npm start -- --port 7070````

## How to import data in iTowns

We take an example the island of Zanzibar, data from a drone.
you can download this [here](www.google.com)

We have 3 types of data 
 - Points Cloud in multiple [.las](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/las-dataset/what-is-a-las-dataset-.htm) 
 - Orthophoto: multi image in .tif with .tfw for information
 - Elevation: multi image in .tif with .tfw for information
 

### Points Cloud 

  You have to install [Potree Converter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter), when you have this 
create a new folder, put the folder point_cloud from Zanzibar file (*.las) .

Write this in the new folder in your console:
```` PotreeConverter Zanzibar/Las/* -o Zanzibar/ --material RGB ````
(It can take time like ~2 3 min)

Now in your folder you should have that: (the format potree) 

<img src="../Image/tutoOpenData_folder.png" width="645" height="100" />

Copy the folder data temp cloud.js and sources.json in 3d-tiles-sample/tileset/Zanzibar/

In iTowns: 

Open the pointcloud.html, change the url [here](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/blob/master/examples/pointcloud.html#L105)
with
````http://localhost:8003/tilesets/Zanzibar/cloud.js ````

Now you should have that: 

<img src="../Image/ZanzibarPointCloud.png"/>

### Orthophoto and Elevation

#### Geoserver 

[install geoserver](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/linux.html) 

If it's not working try with this command:

````GEOSERVER_HOME=/usr/share/geoserver````
 
After that, go on this file /usr/share/geoserver/geoserver-2.11.2/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/
you should have web.xml, open this and uncomment this: 
````
<!-- Uncomment following filter to enable CORS -->
<filter>
  <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
     <filter-class>org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CrossOriginFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
````

and

````
<!-- Uncomment following filter to enable CORS -->
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
````
 
Download [this](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-servlets/9.2.13.v20150730/jetty-servlets-9.2.13.v20150730.jar)
and put it on this folder: /usr/share/geoserver/geoserver-2.11.2/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

Now go [**Geoserver**](http://localhost:8080/geoserver).

Check the [documentation](http://docs.geoserver.org/) if you want undestand what each menu are.

Go on Disk Quota on your right and complet like that:

Create a new gridset...

Then click on Caching Defaults just above gridsets,
like this: 

<img src="../Image/cachingDefaults.png" width="750" height="450" />

Don't forget to add the gridset EPSG:32737 on the bottom.

Now add new Store, 
take the imageMosaic, and do this:

<img src="../Image/stores.png" width="500" height="300" />

And save.

Now you should have the page 'Edit Layer'
Change the name and the title check the Native SRS is correct.

If you have other data you have to change that [here](https://github.com/NikoSaul/itowns2/blob/dataZanzibar/examples/pointcloud.js#L20)
the EPSG: and the [values](https://github.com/NikoSaul/itowns2/blob/dataZanzibar/examples/pointcloud.js#L26) with the native bounding box, you can see it on the geoserver 

And [here](https://github.com/NikoSaul/itowns2/blob/dataZanzibar/examples/pointcloud.js#L113) you have to change the name with the name of your layer same for the projection: [EPSG](https://github.com/NikoSaul/itowns2/blob/dataZanzibar/examples/pointcloud.js#L114).
