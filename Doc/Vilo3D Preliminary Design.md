# Vilo 3D : Preliminary Design

## Goals
* the display of historical documents whithin a 3D representation of the city
* smooth & ergonomic user exploration, of both space and time (temporal slider)
* guided / semi-guided tours to illustrate urbanization processes (docs + text)
* lay the groundwork for future serious game applications

## Positioning
Most existing tools separate the 2D documents (drawings, paintings, photos, maps..) from the 3d scene. Very few examples of direct integration of documents in the 3d scene ([naive example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAWTJO6oz-o&start=58)) : still a research subject. Vilo3D aims to provide new insights on this subject. 

## Target audience
Experts in various fields, ranging from information technology to human sciences. Tools must be easy to use for non-technicians : focus needed on ergonomy.

## Challenges
* visual clarity : image (historical doc) + text (info) + 3d scene
* user movement in 3d space + time (google map camera + temporal slider ?)
* transition between free exploration and guided tour (access, exit, resume)
* display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction

## Ideas
* display the past in grayscale (visual similarity with old photos ?)
