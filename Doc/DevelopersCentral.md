# RICT developer's central

## Step by step inception guide

1. **Pre-requisites** 
   Languages:
     - Frontend: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for the [UDV](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV) (proposed [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript))
     - Backend: [Python3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) for [UDV-server](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV-server) as well as some [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) for some geography/geometry [3DUSE treatments](https://github.com/MEPP-team/3DUSE/tree/master/src/filters)
1. **Access rights** 
   * Provide your github login to the admin in order to ask for a Github access (if you are reading this you probably already did :-)
1. **Documentation** 
   * Browse the [Doc/Devel subdirectory](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/tree/master/Doc/Devel)
1. **Accessing the project sources** 
     Read on the proposed [Github's good practices](DevelopersGithubCycle.md).
1. **Installation**:
   * Clone [UDV](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV/tree/master/), install it and  [run the demos](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV/tree/master/UDV-Core/examples)
1. **Contributing code**
   * Respect (when available) the coding styles
   * [Submit a pull request (PR)](DevelopersGithubCycle.md#submitting-a-pull-request-pr): don't forget to provide a template. Keep in mind that it is much better to often submit small yet effective and mature PR than jumbo/bulk PR once in a while...
   * Place and maintain some gentle pressure when [asking for your pull request (PR) acceptation](DevelopersGithubCycle.md#pull-request-pr-acceptance-policy)
