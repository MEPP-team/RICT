# Need 013: Visualization of documents within a 3D representation of the city

[Associated issue](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/4)

### User story
As a historian I want to visualize and locate documents (images, videos, text...) in the 3d representation of the city. I need a preview of what the document is, and a visual indication of its position in the scene.

Aggregator super need :
* Need 004: [enhancing city models with documents](Need004.md)

### Beneficiary role: 

### Impact: 

### Maturity:

There is a prototype for this need in : https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV/tree/master/Vilo3D . This prototype uses a 2D screen overlay to display the documents as opposed to a 3D spatial insertion (as billboards for instance).

Document Visualization

### Description
There are several ways by which documents can be displayed in a 3D scene. The need can be fulfilled by using billboards [1] integrated in the 3d representation of the city, anchored to the city object which is the subject of the document. Filtering/culling of the billboards may be needed to avoid cluttering. However [1] has been tested in a desktop environment and we also need to test this in a web environment.

There are two important aspects to be considered for every document for document visualization (including billboard display):
* Position and orientation of the document: In billboard display[1], we placed the document (image or document preview) exactly over the concerned city object (non-document city objects). There are other options, like in case of photographs, position the document on the point where the photograph was taken. Other important questions concerning document position:
  * How to automatically obtain document position from document references?
  * What's the position of a document when it refers one or more document objects.
  * How to orient the documents? Always face the camera or maintain a fixed orientation. In billboard display[1], document always face the user/camera. We also tried to maintain a fixed orientation for documents, but we only had a partial view or almost no view of the document as we move around the 3D scene.
* Position and orientation of the camera: The position and orientation of the camera can influence which documents are displayed and which documents are filtered. For exemple, if the camera is very far from the city, documents referencing the city (such as city photographs) should be displayed but if it is closer to some specific city objects (like a zoom on a wall for exemple), then documents related to the wall should be displayed. A more detailed explaination of this proposition can be found in [1]. 

In addition to the above two, we could consider other parameters like the number of documents : if we look at the whole city but no documents are available at the scale of the city, then it might be interesting to display documents referencing its composing city objects, etc.
