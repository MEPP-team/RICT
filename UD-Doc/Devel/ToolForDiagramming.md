When working the design or the documentation, diagrams and
mostly UML diagrams are a must have. Here are some recommandable
portable (accross OSes) tools with text based formats (mandatory
for git repositories):

* [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com/) 
  - Integrated within Gitlab/github (images generated on the fly)
  - UML oriented: perfect for sequence diagrams
  - Misses diagram manual layout control (they all do)
 
* [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) (
  [memaid on readthedocs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid))
  - Integrated within Gitlab/github (images generated on the fly)
  - Misses diagram manual layout control
  - Quite some limitations concerning some UML views
 
* [Pyton diagrams](https://pypi.org/project/diagrams/)
   - Mostly for deployment/control diagrams
