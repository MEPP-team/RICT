## Features
  - Creating nodes and links with labels
  - Collaboratie edition, with mail invitation, and chat on the same page as the mindmap
  - Automated mindmap history, and cloning of an old revision to a new mindmap
  - Sharing the mindmap without access control with a simple URL, letting view the mindmap but not modify it
  - PDF, PNG image, text file exports (and `.vsdx`, `.mm` ?)
  - Rree version limited to 3 private mindmaps, a limited colormap, and limited nodes and lines shapes
## Limits
  - Impossible to create anything else than trees, eg graphs! Is it a common limitation shared by all mindmap tools?
  - Warning, experienced bug: a full tree just disappeared without any reason, even corrupting the versionning history!
