## Introduction
According to the 
[wikipedia introduction of Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))
```
   Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level
virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
   Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software,
libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other
through well-defined channels. 
   All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore
use fewer resources than virtual machines.
```
Note: Docker native OS is linux (on OSX you need a virtualization layer):
