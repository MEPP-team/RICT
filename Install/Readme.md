## How to install demos out of their integrated components<a name="top"></a>
The [RICT web based online demos](http://rict.liris.cnrs.fr/index.html) regroup a set of specific demos that illustrate various visualizations/applications on top city related data. Each such demo is achieved by integrating some ad-hoc subset of [free and open available software components](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md) (refer to the [architecture](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Readme.md)).

The following documentation considers each specific demo and for each one explains
  - **which required components** should be installed: **don't install all the components** but stick to the _SUBSET_ required for the demo you are trying to replicate (taken among [all the available components](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md))
  - **how to install such components** and
  - **how to assemble/integrate such components** in order to obtain a fully functionnal demo

Once your chosen demo is installed feel free to experiment with it, extend it and/or customize it to suit your needs.

## Installing demos
### <a name="install-demo-udv-front-end"></a>[UDV front end](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md#ComponentUDV) (and no back end component)
 * What you get: something similar to [this demo of the UDV front end](http://rict.liris.cnrs.fr/UDVDemo/UDV/UDV-Core/examples/DemoFull/Demo.html) that illustrates enables you to discover the front end features (e.g. [UDV/Geocoding](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md#ComponentUDVGeocoding)). However, because you are not (yet) installing any of server-side components, you will **not** be able to use the features requiring some server-side document management (e.g. [Guided Tour](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md#ComponentUDVGuidedTour) or [Authentication](./Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md#ComponentUDVAuthentication)).
  * [Installation notes](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UDV/blob/master/install.md)
  
### UDV (front end) together with [UDS/API_Enhanced_City](../Doc/Devel/Architecture/Components.md#ComponentUDSAPIEnhancedCity) (back-end)
 * What you get: 
   - you can [run demo this demo](http://rict.liris.cnrs.fr/UDVDemo/UDV/UDV-Core/examples/DemoFull/Demo.html) on your desktop i.e. you will be able to run **both client-side and server-side locally** (on your desktop) as opposed to the [UDV front end previous install demo](#install-demo-udv-front-end) where only the client-side was deployed locally (and the server side was running online on RICT's demo server)
   - note that the server-side component uses a [PostGreSQL database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) used to power components like Consult documentation, Guided Tour, Authentification, Documents to validate and Document Links_.
 * Installation: 
    - first follow [UDV front end install notes](#install-demo-udv-front-end)
    - then [UDS/API_Enhanced_City install notes](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Install.md#backend-udv-serverapi_enhanced_city-install-notes) that enable you to install some of the server-side components on your computer.
