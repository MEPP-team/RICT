This document describes how to obtained some Tiling data out of some specific 
[Lyon MÃ©tropole Open Data](https://data.grandlyon.com/) already stored within a
[3DCity Database](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb).

### Prerequisite (1): Feed urban data to a 3DCityDB
Prior to Tiling the data (describe at next chapter) you first need to [import the orginal data in a 3DCityDB database](DataLyonCityGML2009.md). 
 
### Prerequisite (2): Install and configure Py3DTiles
Follow the [py3Dtiles install notes](https://github.com/MEPP-team/py3dtiles/Tiler/Tilers/CityTiler/Install.md).
For the [database configuration](https://github.com/MEPP-team/py3dtiles/blob/Tiler/Tilers/CityTiler/Install.md#4-configure-the-database-description-file) file (the rest of this description uses the `CityTilerDBConfig_2009.yml` filename) ou should
obtain something like
```
PG_HOST: 'rict.liris.cnrs.fr'
PG_NAME: 'citydb_lyon_2009_full'
PG_PORT: 5432
PG_USER: 'citydb_user'
PG_PASSWORD: 'XXXXXXXXXX'
```

### Running the Tiler WITHOUT the [Batch Table Hierarchy](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/tree/master/extensions/3DTILES_batch_table_hierarchy) 
Running the tiler is a [direct usage case](https://github.com/MEPP-team/py3dtiles/blob/Tiler/Tilers/CityTiler/Install.md#5a-running-the-citytiler)
````
python3 Tilers/CityTiler/CityTiler.py \
        Tilers/CityTiler/CityTilerDBConfig_2009_full.yml
````
You can collect the results from the `junk` sub-directory
````
mv junk ../../<where-you-need-them-to-be>
````

### Running the Tiler WITH the [Batch Table Hierarchies](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/tree/master/extensions/3DTILES_batch_table_hierarchy)
The running invocations goes
````
python3 Tilers/CityTiler/CityTiler.py --with_BTH \
        Tilers/CityTiler/CityTilerDBConfig_2009_full.yml 
````

### Publishing the resulting Tile Sets
A simple way of "publishing" your data (through http) is to use the lightweight [server](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles-samples/blob/master/server.js) offered by the [AGI's 3D-tiles-samples utility](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles-samples.git): you can follow [these simple installation notes](Install3dTilesNodeBasedWebServer.md).
